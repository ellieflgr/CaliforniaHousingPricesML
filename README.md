This is a workthrough project from the second chapter of the book  *"Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"* by Aurélien Géron that I am working through and playing with for educational purposes. **Accordingly, this is (mostly) not my own code**, the original can be found [here](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb). 

As I am following an exploratory approach here, it contains a lot of my own comments, observations and reflections.
