This is a workthrough project from the second chapter of the book  *"Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"* by Aurélien Géron.

I added plenty of code, comments and ideas to it and managed to successfully improve the performance of the model used in the book through applying my own ideas in feature engineering.
